# 100-days-of-ML
A record of my experiences in a commitment to 100 days of ML.

The purpose of this exercise is to get acclimated in the world of ML. Given my
lack of meaningful experience in this topic, I will not bother with setting an
initial roadmap, as what good is a map if I don't even know where I'm going.
Instead I think it will be more worthwhile to venture out and stop by at places
that pique my interest.
